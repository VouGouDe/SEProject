In order for the application to connect with the mySQL Server,
there needs to be a user with the following credentials

	username: user
	password: password

with full privileges. Otherwise changes are needed in the "ConnectionToMySQL.java" file.

Once the database has been loaded, simply run the "TicketSales.jar".

It is an executable version of the application with all the necessary 
.jar file incorporated.
