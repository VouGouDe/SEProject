# SEProject

This is a repository dedicated to the "Create a ticket selling app" Project.
The assignment was due to the 31/1/2017.

The app has functions for two types of users. Admins and cashiers.

Admins can create accounts and delete them, as well as create events and delete them. 
They also have access to statistics regarding the ticket sales of each event.

Cashiers can choose an event, select tickets (where applicable), finalize the purchase and print the tickets.
